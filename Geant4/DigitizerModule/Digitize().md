This method is part of the [[DigitizerModule]] class and is responsible for extracting the data from the [[Hit]] collections generated by the end of an [[Event]]. Or in more general terms, to generate the [[Digi]] collection.

This method must be invoked directly in order for it to be used. A common place to invoke this would be in the [[EndOfEventAction()]] inside the [[EventAction]] class since this is the time when the hit collections would be complete. 

The first step of this method is to create a [[Digi]] collection. For this specific example, the user wants to extract information already collected by the [[Hit]] objects. This can be done by getting the hits collection using a manager class called [`G4DigiManager`](https://gitlab.cern.ch/geant4/geant4/-/blob/master/source/readout/include/G4DigiManager.hh). Once this is done, the user can loop through that collections, creating new digits containing the wanted data. Then finally, the user will store the data in a digit collection. Below is an example of this. **NOTE**: This is an example that is linked to the [[Hit]] collection creation within the [[SensitiveDetector]] and the [[ConstructSDandField()]] notes as well as the example that was started in the [[Digi]] and [[DigitizerModule]] notes:
```cpp
void ExampleDigitizerModule::Digitize() {
	//Create a digit collection of a given detector part (example digitizer), and give it a specific name (example digit collection)
	ExampleDigitCollection* digiCollection = new ExampleDigitsCollection("ExampleDigitizer","ExampleDigitCollection");

	//Initialize digit manager
	G4DigiManager* digiManager = G4DigiManager::GetDMpointer(); 

	//Fetch the hits collection
	hitCollectionID = digiManager->GetHitsCollectionID("ExampleCollection");
	auto hitCollection = digiManager->GetHitsCollection(hitCollectionID);

	for (int i=0; i<hitCollection->entries(); i++) {
		//Get info from hit
		G4ThreeVector position = (*hitCollection)[i]->GetPos();

		//Set digi values
		ExampleDigi* digi = new ExampleDigi();
		digi->SetPos(position);

		//Put digi into the collection
		digiCollection->insert(digi);
	}
}
```
This example is finished in the [[EndOfEventAction()]] section.
